Different sources define vision and mission differently. </p><p><strong>This is my attempt to demystify what the vision, mission, and values as the foundation of a company actually are.</strong> You will learn about their components like their roles, target audience, and what they influence or guide. </p><p>I will also present <strong>a step-by-step guide on how you can start drafting your own mission and vision statement including the core values</strong>. </p><p>It&#8217;s not only useful to create these statements for a company. It&#8217;s also very helpful to create mission and vision statements at a team level to guide and communicate the strategy to everyone involved. </p><p>You can also use the guide to get more insights about what you as an individual want to accomplish and what you truly value. </p><p>&#128161; Let&#8217;s first head over to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/">Cambridge Dictionary</a> for some definitions.</p><h1>Looking for Clarity</h1><p>I found a couple of dictionary definitions that are roughly matching my current understanding of a <strong>vision:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>an idea</strong> or <strong>mental image</strong> of something</p><p>The ability <strong>to imagine</strong> how a country, society, industry, etc. <strong>could</strong> <strong>develop in the future</strong> and <strong>to plan</strong> for this</p></blockquote><p>And for <strong>mission</strong>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Any work</strong> that someone <strong>believes</strong> it is their <strong>duty</strong> to do</p></blockquote><p>And finally for <strong>values:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The <strong>beliefs</strong> people have, especially about <strong>what is right and wrong</strong> and <strong>what is most important</strong> in life, that control their <strong>behaviour.</strong></p></blockquote><h1>The Roles of Mission And Vision Statements</h1><p>Mission and vision <strong>both relate to an organization&#8217;s purpose and aspirations</strong></p><p>Mission and vision statements together <strong>play 2 critical roles</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Communicating <strong>the purpose of the organization</strong> to stakeholders</p></li><li><p>Providing a <strong>high-level guide for the strategy</strong></p><p></p></li></ul><h2>Mission Statement</h2><p>A mission statement communicates the organization&#8217;s reason for being and how it aspires to serve its key stakeholders.</p><p>A mission statement answers the following questions:</p><ul><li><p><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s our reason for being or why do we exist?&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><em>&#8220;How do we aspire to serve our key stakeholders?</em></p></li><li><p><em>&#8220;What do we as a company value?&#8221;</em></p></li></ul><p>The stakeholders are the key parties who have some influence over the organization or stake in its future e.g. employees, customers, and investors</p><p>Look at this example from <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/giveback">Lemonade:</a></p><p><em>&#8220;Transform insurance from a necessary evil into a social good. We&#8217;ve designed Lemonade to bring out the best in people while giving society a push for the better.&#8221;</em></p><h2>Vision Statement</h2><p>The vision statement is a <strong>distilled future-oriented VERSION</strong> of the mission.  Given the mission statement, the vision statement answers or highlights: </p><ul><li><p><em>&#8220;What does our company look like once we achieved our mission?&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><em>&#8220;What does the world look like once we achieved our mission?&#8221;</em></p></li></ul><p>The strategy flows directly from the vision since the strategy is intended to achieve the vision and thus satisfy the organization&#8217;s mission.</p><p>Being future-oriented, a vision statement can really help to inspire and motivate people working towards the dream future for the company. A well-communicated and easy-to-understand vision can definitely boost employee engagement levels. </p><p>Take this example from Airbnb. Here the vision statement is only a more narrow version of the mission statement. <strong>The mission already includes the vision.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> <em>&#8220;To live in a world where one day you can feel like you&#8217;re home <strong>anywhere</strong> &amp; not in a home, but truly home, where you <strong>belong</strong>.&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Vision Statement:</strong><em> &#8220;Belong Anywhere.&#8221;</em></p></li></ul><h1>What About Values?</h1><p>Core values are <strong>part of the mission statement</strong>.  The format of a mission statement can differ and often companies use different formats to communicate the same thing. Sometimes:</p><ul><li><p>the values are <strong>summarized in the mission.</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>guiding principles are added</strong> to elaborate on the organization&#8217;s values.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Values dictate behavior.</strong> They have to include <strong>verbs</strong>. They have to be actionable. It is not possible to execute based on the word <em>&#8220;innovation&#8221;</em>. <em>&#8220;Look at the problem from a different angle&#8221;</em> is something that you can do.</p><p>It has to be <strong>possible to decide what is right and wrong behavior</strong> based on these values. They should be used to guide employee behavior.</p><p>Values can also be <strong>an emotional touch point for your customers.</strong> </p><p>Let&#8217;s give some examples. </p><h2>Examples</h2><h3><strong>Patagonia</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.patagonia.com">Patagonia</a> summarizes the core values in the mission statement.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;<strong>We&#8217;re in business to save our home planet</strong>.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote><p>Via its website, Patagonia has chosen to only communicate its <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/core-values/">core values</a>. All of them together can be viewed as an elaborate version of the mission statement.</p><ul><li><p>Build the best product</p></li><li><p>Cause no unnecessary harm</p></li><li><p>Use business to protect nature</p></li><li><p>Not bound by convention</p></li></ul><p>Patagonia is a great example of a company that <strong>creates an emotional touch point for the customers.</strong>  People that really care about creating a sustainable environment will appreciate the brand Patagonia together with its products. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg" width="255" height="382.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2184,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:255,&quot;bytes&quot;:2031256,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18c58624-af7d-4969-8c8e-dd73ee5967fb_3648x5472.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Patagonia values are shared by customers</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Patagonia has not officially published a vision statement.</strong> The added value of a vision statement can be limited since the vision statement is a distilled or sometimes tagline version of the mission statement. </p><h3>Starbucks</h3><p>This is the <a href="https://www.starbucks.in/about-us/company-information/mission-statement.html">mission statement from Starbucks</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>to inspire and nurture the human spirit &#8211;

The <strong>mission and vision statement</strong> both relate to an organization&#8217;s goals and hopes for the future. Together they <strong>communicate the organization&#8217;s reason for being</strong> and they provide <strong>a high-level guide for the strategy.</strong></p><p><strong>The mission statement includes the core values</strong> which describe what a company feels is important. <strong>Values should be actionable</strong> and be used to guide desired behavior. </p><p>The vision statement is a more narrow future-oriented version of the mission. It describes what the world looks like once the vision is achieved and this mission is satisfied.  Sometimes the mission statement already includes the vision.</p><p>Last but not least, I presented <strong>a step-by-step guide</strong> for drafting your own mission and vision statement including the values.

You don&#8217;t have evidence that they care enough to buy it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product-Market Fit: </strong>A need is identified and validated in the market. The customers from that market are also prepared to buy what the business creates. </p></li><li><p><strong>Business-Model Fit: </strong>The value proposition creates value for your customers. The business model also creates value for your organization. The business model is now profitable.</p></li></ul><p>Profitable businesses capture more value from the customers than it costs to create and deliver their products and services. </p><h2>Decomposing the Business Process</h2><p>We can use the definition of the business model to divide the business process into three sequential steps. Each subprocess includes people that do the work. These people use technology to make the work they do more efficient.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png" width="842" height="152" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:152,&quot;width&quot;:842,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:32288,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b69879d-4c78-486a-b9fb-ca2392afd104_842x152.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p><strong>Creating, delivering, and capturing value are all primary activities or core business processes.</strong> They are essential for adding value and creating a competitive advantage. When further decomposing these processes, we can make make a distinction between core and supporting processes. <strong>The role of the supporting processes is to help make the core processes more efficient.</strong></p><p><strong>Examples of core business processes:</strong> product development, logistics, marketing, and sales</p><p><strong>Examples of supporting business processes:</strong>  accounting, finance, quality control, human resource management, procurement, and R&amp;D</p><p>It&#8217;s important to know where a software solution is located in the business process. Is the solution part of a supporting business process or is it part of a core business process? </p><ul><li><p>When a clothing manufacturer sells manufactured clothes via a website, then that website is part of a core business process. </p></li><li><p>When a software company has a public website for recruiting new employees, then that website is part of a supporting process. In this case, recruiting is not the core business. Recruits support the organization in becoming more efficient at the core business processes.</p></li></ul><p>It is not because technology is part of a core business process that you should build it yourself. The company should do what the company is good at and for which it can access the right talent. </p><p>A technology solution that is part of a core business process should match how the business wants to differentiate itself.  If you want to be the most convenient online business to buy a particular product from, then it is important that your website is convenient to use.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Core</strong> business processes create customer value. They should result in <strong>benefits for the customer</strong>. </p><p><strong>Supporting</strong> business processes make the organization more efficient. They should result in <strong>benefits for the organization.</strong></p></blockquote><h1>Challenging The Business</h1><p>By now, you have the necessary foundation to start questioning a solution initiative. Make sure you collect enough information about the items underneath. If no one can provide you with this information, then prepare for failure and a waste of time.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> What problem is this initiative solving? It should include what&#8217;s going wrong, and why it is a problem. It should be clear what customer or business outcomes it relates to and if the problem is part of a core business process or part of a supporting process.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Proof:</strong> Ideally you want proof of the problem. You want to avoid participating in wild guesses.  Evidence should back up the problem statement. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data works best.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Measurement:</strong> How will we measure the success of this initiative? For each outcome, one or more measurable benefits can be inferred. Quantitative data might show us where we are now. Now, where do we want to move the measurable benefits?</p></li><li><p><strong>The Target Audience:</strong> Who are we building this solution for? Is this for employees or for customers? What kind of employees or what kind of customers?</p></li></ol><p>People with the following roles should be able to provide you with answers: business architects/enterprise architects, domain experts, business analysts, product managers, and project managers. </p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>It&#8217;s challenging to create valuable software solutions when there is a disconnection between the business and software engineering. </p><p>In this article, I have explained how I see the business at a macro level. Resources are used as input for the business. The business model processes the resources. The outcome is the output of the process. It represents the change result of implementing the software solution. </p><p>The outcome can be beneficial for either the customer, the business, or both. In the long run, it is important to balance customer outcomes and business outcomes.</p><p>A solution initiative is either part of a core business process or a supporting business process. Core business processes create value for the customers. Supporting business processes make the business more efficient.</p><p>As a software engineering team, it&#8217;s important that there is transparency and clarity about how a software solution fits into the business strategy. You should have at least an idea about the problem to be solved, what will make the solution successful, and the target audience of the solution.</p><div><hr></div><div

They buy better versions of themselves.</strong> </p><p>When you're trying to win customers, are you listing the attributes of the flower or describing how awesome it is to throw fireballs?</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not because you buy a product that it will completely fit your needs. Very often customization or extension of the product is required. Often the product is only a (small) part of the complete solution the customer needs.</p><p>To be or stay successful, businesses that are building solutions have to constantly look for ways to&nbsp;<strong>reduce costs</strong>, <strong>deliver working software faster</strong>, and <strong>meet or exceed their user&#8217;s needs</strong>.</p><p>But also, I&#8217;ve been part of projects or product teams where:</p><ul><li><p>we built solutions no one wanted or did not meet the needs</p></li><li><p>we delivered slowly and introduced bugs frequently</p></li><li><p>the cost of creating solutions was higher than it should be</p></li></ul><p><strong>In this article, I will talk about the software development process, the people doing the work, and the kind of technologies that are used.</strong> The information can be used as a high-level blueprint for which the different parts can be adjusted to your specific needs.</p><h1>Why Is This So Hard?</h1><p><strong>The number of different technologies for creating software is rising</strong>. The amount of highly skilled engineers that can work with advanced technologies is small. Skilled software engineers seem to prefer to work in high-tech environments instead of building domain-specific solutions that are less complex in terms of technology. The total group of traditional software engineers is too small for the increasing demand for digital solutions by businesses. </p><p><strong>An enormous amount of low-code and no-code tools for creating software are already available</strong>. These tools are aimed at less skilled developers. It&#8217;s often not very clear what&#8217;s possible with these tools and what skills are necessary to effectively use these tools.</p><p>Under certain circumstances, it will make sense to opt for a no-code or low-code strategy for building a solution. Sometimes due to the complexity of the project, custom high-code written by skilled software engineers will be needed. And sometimes a combination of strategies is the best choice.</p><p><strong>Businesses often rush to solutions and technologies for building software too quickly.</strong>  They are usually sold on the sole idea that developing software needs less skilled resources and won&#8217;t take a lot of time.  </p><blockquote><p><strong>Creating software is not only about writing code or drag-and-dropping components.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>The chosen development strategy sometimes lacks quantitative and qualitative support.</strong> This increases the risk of a bad outcome for the customer (internal or external), the business, or both. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Bad choices are most often a people problem while all the technology is working fine. The tech just doesn&#8217;t fit your needs.</strong>  </p></blockquote><h1>Creating Software Solutions </h1><p>Businesses are constantly looking to improve the <strong>process</strong> of creating and delivering working software. This means:</p><ul><li><p><strong>reducing costs</strong></p></li><li><p>improving the <strong>speed of delivery</strong></p></li><li><p>meeting and <strong>exceeding customer&#8217;s needs</strong></p></li></ul><p>The smoother the process runs, the better the above goals can be achieved.</p><p>The process of creating a software solution always includes people and technology.  A software solution is equal to the process outcome of how people are working with each other and interacting with technology.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Solution = Process (People + Technology)</strong></p></blockquote><h1>The (SDLC) Process</h1><p>The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process that helps to quickly develop high-quality software ready for production.&nbsp;When researching this process, diverse sources mention different steps. The number of steps is always somewhere between 5 and 8.</p><p>I personally like the steps shown in the picture below.  No matter if you choose an <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall</a> </strong>approach<strong> </strong>of the SDLC, all these steps are important and they all deserve enough attention. Choosing the best SDLC implementation is dependent on many things. Some of them are the needs and complexity of the project and the business.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg" width="600" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:600,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;SDLC methodologies for ensuring effective product development&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="SDLC methodologies for ensuring effective product development" title="SDLC methodologies for ensuring effective product development" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c523db-6d15-4ac7-997b-d573557894bc_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Software Development Life Cycle (<a href="https://nix-united.com/blog/software-development-life-cycle-nix-approach-to-sdlc/">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>1. Strategy</strong></h1><p>A project should always include <strong><a href="https://www.venturewhisper.com/p/demystifying-mission-vision-and-values">a vision</a> and a direction</strong> of the envisioned solution over time. </p><p>The first phase is about <strong>crystalizing the problems that need to be solved</strong>. It&#8217;s also essential to:</p><ul><li><p>have a deep knowledge of your target audience.  </p></li><li><p>look at the alternatives your target audience has including what competitors are offering. </p></li></ul><p>A good strategy and clear goals will create focus, clarity, and alignment for all people involved in the initiative.</p><p><strong>If you get this phase completely wrong, you will end up building software that no one wants (bad enough) and will not be used (enough). All the effort put into the next steps will be a complete waste of time and money.</strong></p><h2><strong>2. Design</strong></h2><p>The design phase is about clarifying technical and functional requirements. </p><p><strong>Technical requirements</strong> include:</p><ul><li><p>a description of the <a href="https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/quality-attributes-in-software-architecture/">software quality attributes</a> the solution needs to have. Some examples are maintainability, reusability, security, and scalability.</p></li><li><p>a high-level architecture and what important building blocks are needed. Examples of building blocks are:</p><ul><li><p>Programming Languages (Java, C#, Python, &#8230;)</p></li><li><p>Products (SaaS, Open Source, Databases, Deployment Environments, Low-Code, No-Code&#8230;)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-software-framework/">Frameworks</a></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>An end-solution is comprised of many different products, custom development, and integrations.</p><p><strong>Functional requirements</strong> are about what needs to be implemented so that the users of the solution can achieve their goals. Prototypes are often built to better understand what the end solution should look like and how it should behave.</p><h2>3. Development</h2><p>During this phase, the software engineering team builds the necessary features that are in scope using the chosen technologies. </p><p>There are multiple ways for building features:</p><ul><li><p>In high-code environments, the features are built by writing code. </p></li><li><p>In no-code environments, building features happens by configuring pre-built components. </p></li><li><p>Low-code development is a mix of high-code and low-code.</p></li></ul><h2>4. Testing</h2><p>This vital phase tests the software to ensure everything works as expected. Defects are fixed when they are discovered. </p><p>Three important types of testing exist:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unit tests</strong> test individual components of an application in isolation (without any interaction with dependencies) to confirm that the code is doing things right.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration tests</strong> check if different components are working fine together. Real dependencies are used.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional tests</strong> test a slice of functionality in the system to confirm that the code is doing the right things. Functional tests often have dependencies.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png" width="693" height="469" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:469,&quot;width&quot;:693,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image result for unit testing vs functional testing vs integration testing&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image result for unit testing vs functional testing vs integration testing" title="Image result for unit testing vs functional testing vs integration testing" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704cdbd4-38db-4d0c-879d-70c36ac760a8_693x469.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Three types of testing (<a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/the-difference-between-unit-integration-and-functional-testing/">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><h2>5.  Deployment</h2><p>Software deployment includes all processes that ensure a software system or update is available to the users. Usually, this includes software release, installation, testing, deployment, and performance monitoring. </p><p>Often different environments are required. You need at the very least 2 depending on the kind of platform that you are using and the complexity and needs of the solution.</p><p>Deployment pipelines enable versioned artifacts to be pushed to higher environments. It&#8217;s also beneficial that rollbacks to previous versions can happen easily.</p><h2>6. Maintenance</h2><p>The lifetime of the solution is not at its end once the solution is deployed. It&#8217;s called the software development <strong>life cycle </strong>for a reason.</p><p>In this phase, the development team processes feedback and <strong>fixes bugs</strong> discovered by users or stakeholders, and <strong>provides ongoing enhancements</strong>. It&#8217;s often crucial that the end solution can be easily customized when changes are needed. </p><p><strong>Make sure that enough people have the necessary knowledge and skill to maintain the solution. </strong></p><h1>People And Technology</h1><p><strong>People should always have the required skills to work with a specific technology.</strong> You can hire professionals that are specialized in that technology or you can train people so that they acquire those skills on the job. <strong>It often happens that training is underestimated.</strong></p><p>Creating a website is much easier than it used to be. Unless you need something very specific with complex integrations and an advanced user interface, most people can already do this by themself.</p><p>Not so long ago, access to people with advanced skills was a prerequisite to building a website. You needed to have a deeper knowledge of user interface design, front-end and back-end programming, databases, networking, and infrastructure.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg" width="652" height="435.2637362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:972,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:652,&quot;bytes&quot;:2885014,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d150ec3-596d-44b4-9c9c-c54e89bda728_6016x4016.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A professional developer at work</figcaption></figure></div><p>Nowadays, there are SaaS solutions where non-technical people can start from a template based on the goal of their website.

The volume of things created with the technology is relatively small and the rate at which they&#8217;re made is small.</p><p>Over time, the technology advances and gets packaged in ways that require less expertise in the technology itself.  It gets easier to apply the technology in the context of a particular domain. People need less advanced skills to take advantage of the technology.</p><p>The cost of creating things with the technology drops. The volume of things created and the rate at which they&#8217;re created rises.</p><h2>Stages of Technology Democratization</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd315f02-1a17-4d54-9750-f7372e251b9e_1600x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The democratization of technology (<a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2018/05/democratizing-martech-marketing-technologists/">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p><a href="http://jsaer.com/download/vol-7-iss-10-2020/JSAER2020-7-10-9-13.pdf">This paper</a> shows that there are five stages that technology goes through as it is being democratized. The stages can be identified by different groups of people.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Discipline Experts</strong>: Tech professionals who are primarily masters of the core technology, independent of the domain in which it is applied. Often small tech-savvy startups are deploying sophisticated forms of technology.</p></li><li><p><strong>Domain Experts:</strong> Tech professionals who master the technology in a particular domain, e.g., marketing technologists who build solutions within the marketing department.</p></li><li><p><strong>Power Users:</strong> Non-tech professionals who develop advanced technical skills in leveraging the technology, e.g., tech-savvy marketing automation platform administrators.</p></li><li><p><strong>Users:</strong> Non-tech professionals, people who are not experts in a particular discipline, can use tools to accomplish tasks in those disciplines. For example, new technological tools enable non-IT experts to build websites themselves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambient/Automatic:</strong> Technology just works within the domain without users needing to explicitly manage/operate it, e.g., where automation or AI simply take over the work.</p></li></ol><h2>Democratization of Software Development</h2><p>Developing software is part of the democratization of technology. That&#8217;s also why we hear the term citizen developer a lot nowadays. Citizen developers are not professional developers but rather tech-savvy domain experts.</p><p>People with advanced skills are becoming more scarce. The demand for professional skilled developers is enormous at the moment. Due to the democratization of technology, more people with limited skills can participate in the process of building software solutions.</p><p><strong>Software engineers will never become redundant. They will need to build the development platforms and tooling so that less skilled users can create software solutions.</strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.venturewhisper.com/p/the-basics-of-creating-valuable-software/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.venturewhisper.com/p/the-basics-of-creating-valuable-software/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p><strong>When building a solution, it&#8217;s important to focus on the benefits for the end-user instead of focusing on the features of a product.</strong> Building solutions that don&#8217;t meet the user&#8217;s needs is just a waste of time and money. </p><p>The Software Development Life Cycle process is an abstract and circular process that consists of multiple steps. There are many ways to implement it.  All the different implementations need to take into account the following steps: strategy, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Choosing the best implementation of the SDLC process is dependent on many factors. These include the complexity and the needs project, and the business.</p><p><strong>The process of creating a software solution always includes people and technology. </strong>People should always have the required skills to work with a specific technology.  <strong>Software development is part of the democratization of technology.</strong> The democratization of technology means that <strong>over time more people have access to specialized knowledge without the need for extensive training.</strong></p><p><strong>There will always be a need for software engineers. They will enable software solution building for less skilled users. </strong></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg" width="709" height="295" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:295,&quot;width&quot;:709,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Sirris&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Sirris" title="Sirris" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f71ad5-7a36-4f5c-b6df-eb6c66751744_709x295.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>At <a href="https://www.sirris.be/">Sirris</a>, we help you make better digital investments</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>We provide <strong>vendor-neutral guidance</strong> on how you can build valuable digital solutions and products.</p></li><li><p>We <strong>focus on people and processes</strong> and never look at technology in isolation.</p></li></ul><p>Schedule a free conversation now if you want to maximize the impact of your digital initiative.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://calendly.com/nielsholvoet/free-30-minute-consultation&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Free Conversation&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://calendly.com/nielsholvoet/free-30-minute-consultation"><span>Free Conversation</span></a></p><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.venturewhisper.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Venture Whisper!

This work is attractive because it&#8217;s easy, which makes us feel productive, and it&#8217;s rich in personal interaction, which we enjoy.</p><p><strong>Knowledge workers should need to spend more time engaged in deep work</strong> &#8212; cognitively demanding activities that leverage our training to generate rare and valuable results, and that push our abilities to continually improve.</p></blockquote><p>Cal mentions <strong>three key benefits generated by deep work</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Continuous improvement of the <strong>value</strong> of your work output.</p></li><li><p>An increase in the total <strong>quantity</strong> of valuable output you produce.</p></li><li><p>Deeper <strong>satisfaction</strong> (aka., &#8220;passion&#8221;) for your work.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Deep work has benefits for both the business and the employee. </strong>This is closely related to what I talked about in one of my previous articles: <a href="https://venturewhisper.substack.com/p/boost-your-business-by-creating-happiness">Boost your Business by Creating Happiness</a></p><h1>The Five Levels of Remote Work</h1><p>I am currently reading the book <a href="https://think-boundless.com/the-pathless-path/">&#8220;The Pathless Path&#8221; </a>by <a href="https://think-boundless.com/about/">Paul Millerd</a>.

Automattic is considered a role model and innovator in the area of remote work. It has been <strong>entirely remote</strong> since 2005, and with almost 2000 employees, it has helped prove that remote workplace culture can succeed at scale.</p><p>Remote-first companies have employees in different time zones all over the world. Employees also have the flexibility in deciding when to start and end their working day.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The biggest challenge that globally distributed remote companies are solving is &#8230; COMMUNICATION. </strong></p></blockquote><p>Since the pandemic, lots of companies were forced to adopt remote work quickly. Remote tooling like Slack, Teams, GSuite, Zoom and Miro were introduced.</p><p><strong>Many of these companies are somewhere between level 2 and level 3 of the pyramid shown below. These companies are remote-friendly and offer the flexibility to work from home.</strong>  Most companies still expect their employees to come into the office at least some of the time.&nbsp;But apart from the flexibility, there are no significant business advantages. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png" width="958" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:958,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Five levels of remote work by Matt Mullenweg and Automattic&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Five levels of remote work by Matt Mullenweg and Automattic" title="Five levels of remote work by Matt Mullenweg and Automattic" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e2fcfd-c2c2-4f25-a78c-dc0ade6da959_958x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A company starts to witness the real power or remote working once it is operating at level 4. <strong>At that level, REAL asynchronous communication is used.</strong> </p><p>When reaching level 4, the company can call itself remote-first.  Remote-first isn&#8217;t the same as remote-friendly. <strong> Remote-first is a whole new way of organizing a company.</strong> I start to roll my eyes when I see job descriptions where a company is offering the flexibility to work from home 2 days a week. In that case, working from home will most likely result in more trouble collaborating. </p><p>How many of you enjoy &#8220;hybrid meetings&#8221;?

This is in contrast to communication where an answer is expected (almost) immediately.  </p></blockquote><p>These are some examples of <strong>synchronous</strong> communication:</p><ul><li><p>All kinds of <strong>meetings</strong>: virtual (e.g. Zoom), hybrid, at the office</p></li><li><p>Tapping someone on the shoulder at the office to <strong>ask a quick question</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Phone calls</strong></p></li></ul><p>These are examples of <strong>asynchronous communication channels</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Emails</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Instant Messaging</strong>: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborative Designer Tools</strong>: Figma, Marvell</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Video Messaging</strong>: Loom</p></li></ul><p>Email and instant messaging are asynchronous communication channels by nature. <strong>How these remote tools are used, is influenced greatly by company expectations and culture.</strong></p><p>These are things that are happening at companies with remote and &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; tooling but are not remote-first:</p><ul><li><p>You are expected to be online in Slack or Teams. Otherwise, your boss might think you are not working. </p></li><li><p>You are supposed to follow up on IM notifications on many channels (even if the messages posted over there are not business critical). </p></li><li><p>People video call you out of the blue and you are supposed to accept them.</p></li><li><p>You are expected to have your email client open. </p></li><li><p>Email is the primary method of communication.

It also benefits the company.  Introverts thrive more when they can think in solitude. It will also lead to better decisions where everyone participates more equally in the discussions.</p><h1>Remote-First</h1><p>What&#8217;s happening at a remote-first company? I studied some companies that operate fully remote and sell remote-first products.</p><h2>Ditch Recurring Meetings</h2><p>Meetings are reduced to an absolute minimum. <a href="https://slite.com/blog/no-recurring-meetings">Recurring meetings are ditched</a> and replaced by asynchronous communication.  Recurring meetings are often about accountability.</p><p>Some examples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Standups</strong>: <em>&#8220;What did you do yesterday, what are you going to do today, any difficulties?&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Reporting:</strong> <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s the status of the project?&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Announcements and updates:</strong> <em>&#8220;We landed a new enterprise customer!&#8220;</em></p></li></ul><h2>Use Asynchronous Video Calls</h2><p>With tools like <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a> or <a href="https://www.claap.io/">Claap</a>, it is possible to replace a whole range of meetings with video recordings. These tools allow you to give contextual feedback to one another and have discussions inside that tool. It is for example possible to put comments or ask for input at a certain moment in time of that video.</p><p>These tools can be used for a whole range of interesting use cases:</p><ul><li><p>Centralizing and sharing team knowledge</p></li><li><p>Collaborating asynchronously</p></li><li><p>Asynchronous team planning</p></li><li><p>Delivering feedback faster</p></li><li><p>Training and building teams</p></li><li><p>&#8230;</p></li></ul><h2>What Meetings to Keep</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Social bonding:</strong> offsites where the whole team meets in person for a combination of work, fun, and offline connecting. <a href="https://www.donut.com/remote-connections/">Donut</a> chat helps to welcome new hires, build internal networks and virtually meet &#8220;strangers&#8221; for coffee or lunch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manager check-ins:</strong> It&#8217;s beneficial to organize a 1-on-1 between a manager and a direct report synchronously. This can be done via a video call.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hiring</strong>: Some parts can happen in writing but at a certain point, it&#8217;s best to meet in person using a video call.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Meetings: </strong>Gathering qualitative data and feedback from customers often requires a live meeting.</p><p></p></li></ul><p>Email and instant messaging tools like Slack are asynchronous but they have some real disadvantages:</p><ul><li><p><strong>They bury information.</strong> You might miss important discussions when being out of the office for a couple of days or just plain busy.  </p></li><li><p>The information is <strong>not well organized</strong> and it&#8217;s difficult to find the necessary information after a while. </p></li></ul><p>Tools like <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a> are <a href="https://blog.doist.com/betting-against-slack/">betting against Slack</a> for exactly those reasons.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The remote-first model is beneficial to all companies that heavily depend on knowledge workers. Companies can achieve more with fewer people. This is particularly interesting since it is so hard to attract top talent.</p><p><strong>On average, knowledge workers only do meaningful work 2 days out of five. </strong> The main reason is that they are frequently distracted and interrupted. <strong>The more interruptions, the harder it is to engage with deep work.</strong> More time for deep work is beneficial for both the employees (more satisfaction) and the company (more value).</p><p><strong>People are different.</strong> They do their best work under different circumstances and at different times during the day.</p><ul><li><p>Meetings are challenging for introverts. They benefit from more preparation and written communication. </p></li><li><p>Some people feel more energized in the morning, others in the evening.</p></li></ul><p>Remote-friendly offers flexibility to employees to work from home. These companies  still have an office-first culture which makes collaboration more difficult. Remote-first is not only about remote work. It&#8217;s mainly a different culture. </p><p>At remote-first companies:</p><ul><li><p>Recurring meetings are ditched</p></li><li><p>Some meetings are replaced by asynchronous video calls. </p></li><li><p>Hiring,  manager check-ins, customer meetings, and social bonding are exceptions for organizing meetings.</p></li><li><p>Email and instant messaging tools are replaced by tools that promote structure and do not bury information.</p><p></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p>I would also like to hear <strong>YOUR thoughts or questions</strong> about this topic:</p><ul><li><p>How much can you engage with deep work at your job?

We should first focus on <strong>deciding WHAT problem should be solved before focussing on HOW to solve that problem</strong>. Following Einstein his advice, everything discussed in this article will be <strong>solution agnostic</strong>.</p><h1>It&#8217;s a People Problem</h1><p>It&#8217;s important to get more insights into these transformation failures before diving into the steps required to mitigate those failures.  I did some research and I bumped into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2022/03/16/12-reasons-your-digital-transformation-will-fail">this interesting article</a>. It does an amazing job summarizing the reasons why projects fail. </p><p>According to the article, one main reason for failure is <strong>the lack of a solid business case </strong>supported by quantitative and qualitative (financial) data. This lack can result in:</p><ul><li><p>Prioritization based on politics</p></li><li><p><a href="https://nesslabs.com/shiny-toy-syndrome">Shiny toy syndrome</a> that leads to the wrong technology choice</p></li><li><p>No alignment with business outcomes</p></li><li><p>Slow-decision making process</p></li></ul><p>The business case should also <strong>be a team effort</strong> and all stakeholders should be <strong>involved</strong>. If you have no or minimal buy-in, it will be tough to succeed. Some things that can happen:</p><ul><li><p>Employees will sabotage the initiative because of the fear of being replaced.</p></li><li><p>When people don&#8217;t understand what you want to achieve and what the benefits are, they will reject new tools, software, and processes. </p></li></ul><p>Someone should also be responsible for the initiative that does not get lost in implementation details but focuses on the high-level goals. Some managers focus too much on details and lose sight of the bigger picture.</p><p>The important takeaway here is that most of the time the <strong>technology is doing just fine, but the people are getting in the way of success</strong>.</p><p>After examining and agreeing to this, I kept on questioning what the underlying cause could be.

Business cases are prepared <strong>during the project initiation phase</strong> and their purpose is to include all the project&#8217;s objectives, costs and benefits to convince stakeholders of its value.</p></blockquote><p>This is a great summary and it&#8217;s also more or less what I have experienced in past projects. The quality of business cases was often not great. I also recognize some of the failure symptoms of a digital transformation presented before.</p><p>Guess what? I was operating in a siloed organization before and the business cases were initiated in that silo. As already mentioned, business cases were often inferior. They were <strong>vague, biased, focused on a specific technology, and were not supported by qualitative or quantitative data.</strong></p><p>It would be easy to blame the project manager. However, these flawed business cases are <strong>not only the fault of the project manager</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>He is expected to initiate business cases. </p></li><li><p>He feels responsible to land the necessary budget and work for other team members from the same siloed team. </p></li><li><p>There are often close deadlines for business case submissions.  </p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s difficult to present the best solution because the team has <strong>no helicopter view</strong> over the company.  </p></li><li><p>Very often quantitative and qualitative data for supporting the business case is also out of reach.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.flowtrace.co/collaboration-blog/breaking-down-silos-would-have-avoided-these-4-tech-startup-failures#:~:text=Four%20archetypes%20of%20failure%3A%20imperialist,can%20seal%20itself%20off%20internally.">If I have to guess the root cause of these bad business cases, it is the company</a>. The company is often what causes the problems for the silo including inferior business cases.</p><p>A company that operates in a silo nurtures employees to care less about the company as a whole. Employees are loyal to the silo and its objectives. The employees also lack information about the other silos. </p><p><strong>For a higher success rate, business cases should be initiated at the level of the business.</strong>  These initiatives can, later on, be decomposed into multiple lower-level projects. Teams can then further develop these projects. Working in silos makes everything more difficult and will lead to at least some of the problems mentioned before.</p><h1>Helicopter View</h1><p>The first challenge to succeed as a company is to pick the right battle.  </p><p>A business capability model is a great tool to make the right strategic choices on where to focus first.  I see it as a helicopter view of <strong>WHAT</strong> a business <strong>does independently of processes, technology, and organizational structures</strong>. </p><div

These offer the company competitive differentiation</p></li><li><p><strong>Core</strong>: These are part of the business model and relate to the creation, delivery, and capture of value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supporting: </strong>These support the core or strategic capabilities.

Running a business requires so much from an individual. It seems almost impossible to stay happy when <strong>mental </strong>and<strong> physical</strong> <strong>health </strong>is often ignored. </p><p>On the other hand, I can also imagine that there is happiness in the journey of founders and their businesses. Reaching a vision or milestones towards that vision should bring at least some excitement and pleasure.</p><p>In this article, I will briefly talk about what happiness is and what exactly makes people happy. Then I will dive into who&#8217;s generally happier: entrepreneurs or employees. </p><p>Finally, I will demonstrate how it should be possible to <strong>boost your business by focusing on company-wide happiness</strong>.

He&#8217;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychologist">social psychologist</a> and author of an international bestseller&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumbling_on_Happiness">Stumbling on Happiness</a>. So, this guy knows his stuff and everything he says is backed by science.</p><p>The talk provided <strong>some interesting insights</strong> into what makes us happy:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Marriage</strong> makes us happy, but ONLY if it&#8217;s a good one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Children</strong> on average do not make us any happier. For younger people, single or divorced people, children actually make us (on average) unhappy. It seems that the harder you have to work for it, the less happy they make you. That&#8217;s also why men are on average happier when they have children compared to women.</p></li><li><p><strong>Money</strong> makes us happy when we have more of it. But the more you have, the less an increase impacts your happiness. So, when poor people become middle-class, they become a lot happier. On the other hand, If you are already rich and you become Bill Gates rich, it does not make you any happier.</p></li></ul><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp" width="1024" height="529" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17906,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9454cc99-39cf-42f3-8fb7-523c64dc3962_1024x529.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">How income impacts happiness (<a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>What we do with our money also impacts our happiness. We become happier when we spend it:</p><ul><li><p>more on <strong>experiences</strong> and less on things</p></li><li><p>more on <strong>others</strong> and less on ourselves</p></li></ul><p>We become happier from spending the same amount of money on travel and dining compared to spending that amount on a fancy new car.

(So being cheap does not make you happy)</p><p><strong>Work on average does not make us very happy, the same goes for resting.</strong>  Even TV and talking to people make us on average happier than working and resting. So millionaires that only take naps on their shiny big boat are not necessarily happier. </p><p>In order to be happy, life needs balance. We should not focus exclusively on <strong>money</strong> alone, but also on our <strong>mental</strong> and <strong>physical health</strong>. Career, family, friends, exercise, and eating healthy should all be balanced if you pursue happiness.

According to <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317909X472067">this study</a>, <strong>the biggest predictor of health and happiness is entrepreneurship.</strong></p><p>What causes this, is <strong>the mindset</strong> of the average entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs are driven by a vision. They have autonomy and are more confident that even when things are uncertain, they will figure it out.</p><p>Employees can reap some of the same benefits as entrepreneurs by taking more control of their time and what they do with it.</p><h1>As a Leader</h1><p>While <a href="https://medium.com/mitsupplychain/what-is-a-companys-most-valuable-asset-not-people-4e5b854f713d">some</a> might argue, I still believe that <strong>people are a company&#8217;s greatest asset</strong>. An inspiring vision helps to attract talent and to convince them to join your mission.</p><ul><li><p>Hire people that <strong>share your vision</strong>. People with a ton of scarce skills that don&#8217;t believe in the company's purpose are not a great fit. It&#8217;s better to have people with fewer skills, that are willing to work for it because they are passionate about the vision. Also, a lot can be trained on the job and by coaching them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pay employees enough</strong> so they won&#8217;t leave you. Money is important, but it is not the greatest driver for employees. People are looking for <strong>a sense of</strong> <strong>mattering</strong> and <strong>autonomy</strong> where you as a leader <strong>trust</strong> them to get the job done. Pay them for results and not time spent. Don&#8217;t wait for them to increase their salary, take the initiative.</p></li><li><p>As a leader, use a <strong><a href="https://cmoe.com/blog/leaders-delegation-framework/">delegation framework</a></strong>. Aim to make yourself replaceable. Gradually give team members more autonomy. Be available when they need help and help them grow with the company. Make sure <strong>goals are visible</strong> and <strong>transparent</strong> and that they are aligned with upstream goals. Everyone should feel like they have an impact on the progress towards the ultimate vision.</p></li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In my opinion, the most important values to create a thriving business are <strong>autonomy</strong>, <strong>trust</strong>, and <strong>transparency</strong>. A <strong>transparent, visible vision</strong> aligned with cascading downstream goals will create a purpose for everyone in the company.  Using a <strong>delegation framework</strong> and incorporating <strong>proper coaching</strong> will create growth opportunities and more balance in people's life. Everyone should also invest in their physical and mental health.

When a start-up evolves into a larger corporation, they become slower and people often become too comfortable. </p><blockquote><p>The trigger for this article is a <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/blog/lemonade-company-model/">blog post</a> published by the insurance tech company <strong><a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a></strong> a while ago.  The post explains how they were able to scale their headcount quickly using <strong><a href="https://www.lemonade.com/blog/lemonade-company-model/">&#8220;The Company Model&#8221;</a></strong> while <strong>keeping all of the benefits of a start-up in place.</strong> </p></blockquote><p>Lemonade&#8217;s headcount for example increased from 10 to more or less 1000 while expanding the size of its product offering from two to five.  </p><p>Since Lemonade was founded in mid-2015, this growth is quite impressive. Building an <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/blog/rise-autonomous-organization/">autonomous organization</a> is one of its pillars since its inception. The company is trying to automate everything it can so its employees can focus on more creative and challenging work.</p><p>In this article, I will first summarize <strong>what &#8220;The Company Model&#8221; is</strong>. Next, I will highlight what I think <strong>the secret ingredients</strong> are for scaling headcount rapidly. Finally, I will also cover if and how this model can work in a<strong> remote environment</strong>. </p><h2>The Company Model</h2><p>&#8220;The Company Model&#8221; as presented by Lemonade can be seen as an extension of <a href="https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/spotify-model-scaling-agile/">The Spotify Model</a>. </p><p>In both models, the organizational concepts of  <strong>Squads</strong> and <strong>Tribes </strong>are used. The Company model extends this with the &#8220;Company&#8221; concept where each product is also governed by a <strong>&#8220;Company&#8221;</strong>.</p><p>Another difference is that &#8220;The Spotify Model&#8221; is limited to engineering and product teams, whereas &#8220;The Company Model&#8220; is used beyond that. Lemonade for example also applies the model to Growth teams. </p><p>&#8220;The Company Model&#8221; does not exist solely out of Companies, Tribes, and Squads. There is also room for shared departments like &#8220;Finance, Infrastructure, Communication&#8221;.  More about that later when I talk about the secret ingredients.</p><h3>Squad</h3><p>A Squad can be compared to a <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum">Scrum team</a>. It is self-organizing and has a multi-disciplinary team that should feel like a mini-startup. With all the knowledge present in the Squad, it should be possible to deliver products or services from design to the final product. Every Squad has a long-term mission or objective.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" width="532" height="355.376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:668,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:532,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;people standing on gray concrete stairs during daytime&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" class="sizing-normal" alt="people standing on gray concrete stairs during daytime" title="people standing on gray concrete stairs during daytime" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630569266941-f8a348786bf0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Tribe</h3><p>A Tribe is a group of Squads that are working on the same related products or services.

Each company focuses on a product. When they want to start developing a new product, a new autonomous Company is created. It&#8217;s again like adding a new Lego block to your organization. A Company consists of Tribes and Tribes consist of Squads.</p><h2>The Secret Ingredients</h2><h3>Focus on (<a href="https://www.performyard.com/articles/what-are-cascading-goals-and-how-to-use-them">Cascading</a>) Goals</h3><p>There is a big focus on goals at every level of the organization. </p><p>The organization has a goal but this is also the case as we move downstream to the company, the tribe, the squad, and the individual contributor.</p><p>All these goals or objectives are aligned with one another. This makes it also very clear how every piece of the puzzle fits into the strategy of the company.  At every level, the strategy is broken down further and further until there are clear tasks and deliverables that can be easily tracked and communicated. With this in place, every team member knows exactly how personal efforts impact the organization.</p><h3>Conway&#8217;s Law</h3><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway&#8217;s law</a> is empirically proven and states that:</p><blockquote><p>Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.</p></blockquote><p>Within &#8220;The Company Model&#8221; communication is maximized inside Squads. As we move upstream in the organization, inter-communication between teams and teams of teams decreases.  I think that this is a great way of balancing communication inside an organization.</p><p>Related Squads of the same Tribe need some communication because they are working on the same product and sometimes related features. On the other hand, no communication is needed between different Squads that belong to other Companies.</p><p>Different Companies also need to synchronize in some way in order to make sure the products don&#8217;t diverge too much and to enable cross-selling.</p><h3>Supporting and Primary Teams</h3><p>There is a clear distinction between supporting teams and primary teams. This is very related to the supporting and primary activities from the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain">Porter&#8217;s value chain</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png" width="665" height="402.09302325581393" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:338,&quot;width&quot;:559,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:665,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;What is a value chain and why is it important?&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" class="sizing-normal" alt="What is a value chain and why is it important?" title="What is a value chain and why is it important?" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38537fa-719b-4dcf-8d35-596786d83673_559x338.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Primary activities contribute to a product or service's physical creation, sale, maintenance, and support.  Supporting activities support the primary activities.</p><blockquote><p>Everything that contributes directly to <strong>customer value</strong> is part of a Company. Everything that is supporting or indirectly contributing, is part of a shared department. </p></blockquote><h3>Value Teams</h3><p>If we look back at the value chain presented just before, then we can see the different primary activities presented as silos. This makes me think of how traditional companies used to operate. In that case, there are different departments for sales, services, and engineering. Engineering is also divided based on the <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/feature-team-vs-component-team-in-agile/">components</a> they are working on. </p><blockquote><p>In &#8220;The Company model&#8221;, there are no silos.  Companies, Tribes, and Squads are all horizontal and accountable for achieving goals across the value chain.</p></blockquote><h2>Remote First</h2><p>Unlike <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/01/elon-musk-says-remote-employees-pretend-to-work/">Elon Musk</a>, I&#8217;m a major fan of remote work. It saves me an enormous amount of commuting time and it allows for a better balance between my private life and my career.  I&#8217;m also very enthusiastic about traveling. With a limited number of holidays,  I have to really think and plan everything very well. When I&#8217;m on a vacation, I don&#8217;t  have time for slow travel. There is just too much to see or do and time is oh so limited. </p><p>The result is that I&#8217;m mentally rested when I return home but physically, I&#8217;m often exhausted. The idea to be able to work from wherever and whenever and that my work is evaluated based on results instead of exchanging time for money at an office desk, sounds like a dream come true.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" width="514" height="385.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:514,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;woman in orange shirt sitting on white chair reading book&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" class="sizing-normal" alt="woman in orange shirt sitting on white chair reading book" title="woman in orange shirt sitting on white chair reading book" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628872451522-017302a793a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But is all of this possible with &#8220;The Company Model&#8221; and is this also beneficial to the organization? Can this model be applied to fully-distributed teams across different time zones?</p><h3>Agile Manifesto</h3><p>&#8220;The Company Model&#8221; is a scaled version of <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile</a>. Tribes from &#8220;The Company Model&#8221; (and &#8220;The Spotify Model&#8221;)  are located near each other, often on the same floor of a building.  That&#8217;s a huge difference from a setting where everyone works remotely from different parts of the world.</p><p>When inspecting <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">The Agile Manifesto</a>, it mentions <strong>motivated individuals</strong>, <strong>self-organizing teams</strong>, <strong>close collaboration</strong>, and a need for regular <strong>face-to-face conversations</strong>. </p><p>Nowadays, we have an abundance of modern tools like virtual meeting rooms, <a href="https://resources.owllabs.com/blog/asynchronous-communication">asynchronous communication tools</a>, and digital whiteboards at our disposal. That is why I believe that the Agile principles can also be implemented in a fully remote company. </p><h3>Culture</h3><p>It is important however that the model matches the <strong>culture</strong> of the company and that such a culture is built early on.  It&#8217;s a prerequisite that the company is adequately<strong> transparent</strong>, has good <strong>communication,</strong> and is based on <strong>trust</strong>.</p><p>Also more and more start-up companies are going fully remote. From a company perspective, there are also some important benefits.  Remote working is a money saver because no offices should be rented or bought. Remote businesses can also recruit talent from all over the globe. </p><p>What I also see happening with remote-first companies is that group retreats are organized (often to some idyllic place) to boost team spirit. This is a fun way for employees to get to know other employees better on a personal level and to create great memories together.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Scaling a company&#8217;s headcount rapidly is possible using &#8220;The Company Model&#8220; presented by Lemonade. It is an extension of &#8220;The Spotify Model&#8221;.  &#8220;The Company Model&#8220; consists of different &#8220;Companies&#8221;. For each new product, a separate company is introduced. Companies consist of horizontal &#8220;Tribes&#8221; and &#8220;Squads&#8221;.  These organizational concepts have cascading goals.</p><p>Looking at Conway&#8217;s Law, &#8220;The Company Model&#8221; has a communication structure that is optimized for delivering customer value. Companies, Tribes, and Squads deliver value across the value chain.  The model also contains horizontal supportive teams, making it easier to incubate new Companies, Tribes, and Squads.</p><p>Finally, I&#8217;m convinced that this model can also work for a fully remote team using modern tools as long as the right company culture is present.</p><div><hr></div><p>I am very eager to hear YOUR thoughts:</p><ul><li><p>How do you feel as an employee or employer about remote work?
